<:samba:530553475541499914> *You grab onto Samba before you wildly flap her around! Eventually you manage to make her* ***POP*** *back to normal and land onto the ground!* "Oof! Thanks for that!~"
<:samba:530553475541499914> *You grab an air pump and stick it into Samba's mouth. You give her several pumps until you notice that she's back to her normal self! She grabs the hose inside of her mouth and yanks it out.* "Thanks for the help!~"
<:samba:530553475541499914> *You grab an air pump and stick it into Samba's mouth. You give her many, MANY pumps, not realizing you seem to be inflating her to balloon status.
