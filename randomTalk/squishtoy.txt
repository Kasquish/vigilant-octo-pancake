<:samba:530553475541499914> *You grab a spare Hammer item and* ***SLAM*** *it onto Samba! She is now a pancake with stars spinning over her head.* "G-good swing there!~"
<:samba:530553475541499914> *You push a button to suddenly have a piston crash down onto Samba! The piston rises up to have Samba slowly feather down to the ground, gently landing.* "W-woah! That was unexpected!"
<:samba:530553475541499914> *You call for a Golem to use Rollout! The Golem rolls at an incredible speed towards Samba before steamrolling her paper thin! She floats from side to side into the air before floating down the same way!* "Wowie! Th-that was a powerful move!~"
<:samba:530553475541499914> *You approach Samba before slowly pushing her down in a very slow squish as she calmly just stands there. Eventually you manage to completely flatten her! She lays there for a moment before she starts to wriggle around.* "Wowie, this feels weird!~"
<:samba:530553475541499914> *You take a step onto a specific space, but this time there's a shadow over Samba instead! As she wonders what that could be, she immediately gets squashed flat! She lays face down paper thin as Torracat now stands on top of her.*$%^<:Torracat:370628275795394560> "Hope you didn't mind me dropping by for a quick stomp, nyah!~ But ya owe me later!" *She gives a wink to you before she jumps away!*
