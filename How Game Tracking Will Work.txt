Before game:



During game:
-All commands that can be called by a user on their turn can ALSO be called by the host, in case the user is AFK or something.
-When a command is successfully called, Samba will just make a "reaction" to the caller, so as to not interrupt the flow of the game.
-All commands will call a helper function, gameChange. Commands will pass in a list of strings to gameChange, each string representing the database changes made by that command. For example, the hammer command might call it with these strings:
["Namadu:CoinsGained:27",
"Epic Umbreon:CoinsLost:27",
"Namadu:ItemChange:Hammer:Nothing",
"Namadu:SquishedOthers",
"EpicUmbreon:Squished",
"EpicUmbreon:SquishedByItem"]
gameChange will interpret each string in turn, then make the needed changes to the database.
gameChange will also store this list in a temporary variable.
When gameUndo is called by the host, the stored strings will be interpreted in reverse, so the reverse of each change is done.
(For clarity, Samba will actually make a post about which command has been undone. Thus, a brief summary of the command should also be stored.)
